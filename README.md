# Home Depot Clone

+ A Full-Stack React application that clones the Home Depot website. Built the frontend with React.js, the backend with node.js and express.js, and the database with PostgreSQL.
+ Utilized [faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) library to generate dummy data, and fill the database with bulk insertion.
+ Worked on frontend React components and style as well as backend Restful APIs with node.js and express.js.
